left operand operator right operand



	I'm Chad Dabney. I have dabbled in many different industries throughout my life. Starting from the service industry to a brief stint in I.t.- I ended up managing a gamestop for 7 years. During the last year of my employment with gamestop I began my journey to become an E.m.t. I left that shortly after meeting my current wife where we moved to Jeffersonville, Indiana and I found employment as a warehouse associate for amazon. In my free time I enjoy a plethora of activites from playing guitar, cooking,  wow, and dnd. All of these hobbies give me a sort of avenue to create and learn which I feel constantly compled to do.


	as someone who spent their teenage years in many different pizzerias i say breadsticks are completely unecessary and redundant. Not only are you doubling down on carbs but you're also ordering the same dough they make your pizza with at a mark up. To further add insult to this injury they subsidise the labor of assembly to you by providing dipping sauce on the side. If you really stop and think about it, breadsticks are already a built in feature of your pizza. big pizza has tried to pull the wool over our eyes on this for years. When you finish with the main contents of your pizza you are left with what effectivly is a breadstick. so save your money and your wasitling and just stick with a single pizza.
